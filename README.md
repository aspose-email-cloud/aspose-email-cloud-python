# Cloud Email Processing Features
Aspose.Email Cloud is a REST API for creating email applications that work with standard email file formats. This SDK:
- Lets developers manipulate different emails' formats such as Outlook MSG, EML, VCard, and iCalendar files.
- Supports AI functions:

See [Release notes](https://docs.aspose.cloud/email/aspose-email-cloud-20-9-release-notes/).

## How to use the SDK?
The complete source code is available in the [GIT repository](https://github.com/aspose-email-cloud/aspose-email-cloud-python/tree/master/sdk/AsposeEmailCloudSdk).

Use [SDK tutorials](https://docs.aspose.cloud/email/sdk-tutorials/).

SDK reference documentation is available in [this README](https://github.com/aspose-email-cloud/aspose-email-cloud-python/blob/master/sdk/docs/README.md).

### Prerequisites

To use this SDK, you need an App SID and an App Key; they can be looked up at [Aspose Cloud Dashboard](https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/#/apps) (it requires free registration in Aspose Cloud for this).

### Installation

You can use it directly in your project via the source code or get a [PYPI Package](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-email-cloud/):

    pip install aspose-email-cloud

See more details about SDK installation in this tutorial: [SDK setup](https://docs.aspose.cloud/email/sdk-setup/).

### Usage examples

To use the API, you should create an EmailCloud object:
```python
from AsposeEmailCloudSdk import api #EmailApi class is here
from AsposeEmailCloudSdk import models #REST API models are here

#...
app_sid = 'Your App SID'
app_key = 'Your App Key'
email_cloud = api.EmailCloud(app_key, app_sid)
```

#### Business cards recognition API
Use `AiBcrApi.parse` method to parse business card image to VCard DTO:
```python
path = 'path/to/image/to/parse.png'
result = email_cloud.ai.bcr.parse(models.AiBcrParseRequest(image_file))
contact = result.value[0]
assert 'Parsed Display Name' in contact.display_name
```
