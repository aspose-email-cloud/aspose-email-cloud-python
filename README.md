SDK reference documentation is available in [this README](sdk/docs/README.md)

### Prerequisites

To use this SDK, you need an App SID and an App Key; they can be looked up at [Aspose Cloud Dashboard](https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/#/apps) (it requires free registration in Aspose Cloud for this).

### Installation

You can use it directly in your project via the source code or get a [PYPI Package](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-email-cloud/):

    pip install aspose-email-cloud

See more details about SDK installation in this tutorial: [SDK setup](https://docs.aspose.cloud/display/emailcloud/SDK+setup)

### Usage examples

To use the API, you should create an EmailApi object:
```python
from AsposeEmailCloudSdk import api #EmailApi class is here
from AsposeEmailCloudSdk import models #REST API models are here
from AsposeEmailCloudSdk.models import requests #Request models are here (all API calls use corresponding request model class)

#...
app_sid = 'Your App SID'
app_key = 'Your App Key'
email_api = api.EmailApi(app_key, app_sid)
```

#### Business cards recognition API
Use `AiBcrParseModel` method to parse business card image to VCard DTO:
```python
image_data = None
with open('/tmp/alex.png', 'rb') as f:
    filedata = f.read()
    image_data = str(base64.b64encode(filedata), 'utf-8')
result = email_api.ai_bcr_parse_model(requests.AiBcrParseModelRequest(
    models.AiBcrBase64Rq(images=[models.AiBcrBase64Image(True, image_data)])))
contact = result.value[0]
```
